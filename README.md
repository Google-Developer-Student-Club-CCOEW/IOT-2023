Hacktoberfest 2023!
Welcome Cummins and MMCOE College students! This repository is designed to facilitate the assignment of GitHub issues to eligible students from Cummins College and MMCOE. To ensure a smooth and efficient process, we have implemented a validation system that requires students to provide specific information when requesting assignment of an issue.

How to Request Assignment:
Create a Pull Request: Start by creating a pull request to request the assignment of an issue. Ensure that your pull request follows the repository's guidelines for issue assignment. 📥

1. Full Name 🧑‍🎓
2. Email Address 📧
3. College Unique ID (RNO) 🔢

Validation Process: Our team will review your pull request to ensure that you are a valid student from Cummins College or MMCOE. We will cross-check the provided information with our records to confirm your eligibility. 🕵️‍♂️

Assignment Confirmation: Once your information is validated, we will assign the requested issue to you. You will receive a notification confirming the assignment. 🎉

**4.** Creating a new branch (IMP) 🌱
This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute in Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not creates a mess. To create a new branch:

```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

**5.** Make changes in source code. 🚀

**6.** Stage your changes and commit 📝

```bash
# Add changes to Index
git add .

# Commit to the local repo
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**8.** Create a [Pull Request/PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) 🛠️
