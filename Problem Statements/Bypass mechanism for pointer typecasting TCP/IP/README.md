Problem Statement - Develop a robust bypass mechanism to safely handle pointer typecasting operations in a way that minimizes the risk of memory corruption or unintended behavior in a software application. 

Description -TCP/IP socket creation typically involves typecasting a struct pointer to the struct "sockaddr_in" to the struct "sockaddr". Pointer typecasting is frowned upon in the embedded community as it may cause memory corruption. Write a bypass mechanism to tackle this issue.
