Problem Statement - Design a schematic and layout for a printed circuit board (PCB) that performs fast and efficient AES-128 encryption, specifically designed for lightweight and secure data protection on IoT devices.

Description - Create a schematic and layout of a printed circuit board (PCB) for a specialized hardware module. AES-128 is an encryption standard that typically consumes a lot of processor resources. To better use this time to allow for more allocation toward other tasks, create a hardware based AES-128 encryptionÂ module. The design process should encompass defining the hardware requirements, selecting appropriate components, and creating a compact, efficient PCB layout that integrates these components. The electrical schematic should illustrate the connections and functions of each component within the circuit, ensuring that data encryption operations are performed securely and at high speed.
